This version requires the use of Bono FW version 20.6.15.0 and newer
This version requires the use of ChiMP FW version 20.6.30 and newer
This version requires the use of bnxt_en version 1.5.3 and newer

Enhancements:
    - JIRA (CTRL-22093) - Distribute the PF pool resources to the VF
			- README.TXT updated with changes for DCB and
			  VF resource distribution

v0.0.13 (Sept 19, 2016)
======================
This version requires the use of Bono FW version 20.6.13.0 and newer
This version requires the use of ChiMP FW version 20.6.12 and newer
This version requires the use of bnxt_en version 1.5.2 and newer

Enhancements:
    - RoCE QOS support is added to the driver.

Fixes:
    - JIRA (CTRL-23043) - ibv_devinfo shows incorrect active_speed in
                  rhel7.3 OS.
Known Issues:
    - RoCE QOS support is tech-preview level. Very light testing
      has been done of this release.
    - Following driver load sequence is recommended to let DCBx
      converge:
        # insmod bnxt_en.ko
        # sleep 180
        # insmod bnxt_re.ko

    - Currently RoCE use Priority-5 and Traffic-Class-1 as defaults.
    - It is recommended to use same host OS version on client and
      server while running NFS-RDMA or iSER tests. Hetrogeneous host
      OS may led to unexpected results. This is due to the incompatible
      ULP server and Client kernel modules.
